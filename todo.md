# Distributed PPR Todo

## Code

- Use Spark and distribute the outer loop of particle filtering (Algorithm 3)
- Run single-source PPR in parallel (Algorithm 2)
- Add index on nodes to search for specific movie name (makes demo more intuitive)

## Experiments

- Compare 3 Algorithms: Non-Distributed Particle Filtering, Single-Source Particle Filtering Combined, and Distributed Particle Filtering
    - Compare Time taken
    - Compare NDCG scores

## Presentation


- Make Slides
  - Introduce the need for PPR in the context of Semantic Search
  - Introduce Particle Filtering Algorithm 
  - Talk about our three baselines
  - Optional: Talk about why 
  - Show demo
  - Cost function of when each of the three approaches is appropriate 

- Record a video of presentation
